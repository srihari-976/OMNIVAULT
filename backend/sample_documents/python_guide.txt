Python Programming Guide

Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

Key Features
- Easy to learn and read
- Interpreted language
- Dynamically typed
- Object-oriented
- Extensive standard library
- Large community and ecosystem

Basic Syntax

Variables and Data Types
```python
# Numbers
integer_num = 42
float_num = 3.14
complex_num = 3 + 4j

# Strings
single_quote = 'Hello'
double_quote = "World"
multi_line = """This is a
multi-line string"""

# Boolean
is_true = True
is_false = False

# Lists
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed_list = [1, "two", 3.0, True]

# Tuples
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# Dictionaries
my_dict = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Sets
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

Control Flow

Conditional Statements
```python
x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")

# Ternary operator
result = "Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
```

Loops
```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

Functions
```python
# Basic function
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Function with default parameters
def power(base, exponent=2):
    return base ** exponent

# Lambda function
square = lambda x: x**2

# Function with variable arguments
def sum_all(*args):
    return sum(args)

def print_info(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

Object-Oriented Programming
```python
class Dog:
    # Class variable
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance variables
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def description(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"
    
    def speak(self, sound):
        return f"{self.name} says {sound}"

# Inheritance
class GoldenRetriever(Dog):
    def __init__(self, name, age, color):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.color = color
    
    def fetch(self):
        return f"{self.name} is fetching!"
```

File Handling
```python
# Reading a file
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

# Writing to a file
with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")

# Appending to a file
with open('file.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write("\nNew line")

# Reading line by line
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())
```

Exception Handling
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
else:
    print("No errors!")
finally:
    print("This always executes")

# Raising exceptions
def validate_age(age):
    if age < 0:
        raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative")
    return age
```

Common Libraries

Data Science

Best Practices

1. Follow PEP 8 style guide
2. Use meaningful variable names
3. Write docstrings for functions and classes
4. Keep functions small and focused
5. Use list comprehensions for simple loops
6. Handle exceptions appropriately
7. Use virtual environments
8. Write tests for your code
9. Use version control (Git)
10. Document your code

Common Patterns

Decorator Pattern
```python
def timer_decorator(func):
    import time
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end - start:.2f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def slow_function():
    time.sleep(1)
    return "Done"
```

Context Manager
```python
class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode
        self.file = None
    
    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
        return self.file
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()

with FileManager('test.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("Hello!")
```
