      "content": "When you upload a file here and then ask a question, the system does not just dump the whole file into the model and pray. That would be expensive, slow, and frankly amateur hour.\n\nInstead, it follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.\n\nFirst, file ingestion.\nYour uploaded file—PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, whatever—gets parsed. Headings, paragraphs, tables: all extracted as clean text. Garbage formatting is stripped. Think of this as converting a messy human document into machine-digestible prose.\n\nNext, chunking.\nThe text is split into smaller, overlapping chunks. Not random slices—semantic chunks. The goal is to keep ideas intact while staying within token limits. A paragraph about “loan EMI formulas” should not be glued to a paragraph about “neural networks.” Context matters.\n\nThen comes the clever bit: embeddings.\nEach chunk is converted into a numerical vector—hundreds or thousands of dimensions—that represents meaning, not keywords. Similar meanings sit close together in vector space. This is why you can ask a question without matching exact words and still get the right answer. Math, but poetic math.\n\nThose vectors are stored in a vector database.\nNot a traditional SQL table. This thing is optimized for semantic similarity search. Given a new vector, it can instantly say, “These chunks smell most like this idea.”\n\nNow you type a query.\nYour question is also embedded into a vector using the same model. Apples to apples. No cheating.\n\nThen comes retrieval.\nThe system searches the vector database and pulls the top-k most relevant chunks from your uploaded file. Not the whole file—only the parts that matter for this question.\n\nFinally, generation.\nYour original query + the retrieved chunks are sent to the language model. The model is instructed:\n“Answer using this context. Don’t hallucinate. Don’t improvise. Stay grounded.”\n\nThe output you see is the model reasoning over your document, not its general training data., do summarize this",
