He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, and passed away on January 30, 1948. Known for his philosophy of non-violent civil disobedience, Gandhi inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.\n\nGandhi's methods included fasting, protests, and non-cooperation with British authorities, which eventually led to India's independence in 1947. His message of love, compassion, and self-discipline continues to inspire people globally, making him one of the most influential figures in history.",
